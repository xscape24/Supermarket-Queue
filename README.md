# Supermarket Queue Simulator 

## Overview
This project simulates a supermarket environment where multiple cashiers serve incoming customers who wait in queues. The goal is to model the queue behavior and analyze cashier performance and customer wait times to gain valuable real-world insights.

---

## Features
- Simulates multiple cashier queues  
- Generates customers dynamically throughout the program  
- Tracks queue lengths and cashier status  
- Displays real-time updates in the console  

---

## Project Structure
- `Customer.java` – Represents a customer with a unique ID, arrival time, service time, and tracks which queue they are assigned to  
- `CheckoutQueue.java` – Manages the queue for each cashier, tracks queue length, cashier busy time, and next available time  
- `Simulation.java` – Handles the main simulation logic, generates customers, processes arrivals and departures, and records events and timeseries  
- `Main.java` – The driver class that initializes the simulation with parameters and runs it  
- `run_001_results.csv`, `run_001_events.csv`, `run_001_timeseries.csv`, `run_001_summary.json`, `run_001_config.json` – Output data files generated by the simulation  
- `README.md` – Provides documentation, setup instructions, and explanation of the project structure
