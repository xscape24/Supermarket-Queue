## Features
- Simulates multiple cashier queues  
- Generates customers dynamically throughout the program  
- Tracks queue lengths and cashier status  
- Displays real-time updates in the console

- `CashierQueue.java` – Manages the queue for each cashier using a LinkedList  
- `Main.java` – The main driver for the program that simulates queue behavior  
- `README.md` – Provides documentation and setup instructions for the project
